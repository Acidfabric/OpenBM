This is the firmware component of the OpenBM avr board.

1. Required libraries
----------------

You would need to have avr build environment installed. On Ubuntu 14.04 you
need to install following:

sudo apt-get install avr-libc gcc-avr avrdude


2. Compilation
---------------

To compile the project just execute the build.sh script with the according
customer settings as specified in Customers.ini. This file contains all
information about the used hardware and encodes default settings enbaled in
the firmware. An example customer "user" is already defined, reflecting my
own settings. Hence to build the project with settings "user" execute:

./clean.sh
./build.sh user

this results in bmwMonitor.out file which need to be flashed on-to OpenBM.

3. Installation
------------------
To install an avr programmer must be connected. Avrdude must installed.
Change Makefile.custom to reflect programmer you use, i.e. change
AVRDUDE_PROGRAMMERID line. In order to install execute:

./install.sh user

The firmware can also be installed with any other avr flashing tools.
