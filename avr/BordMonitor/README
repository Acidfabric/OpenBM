This is the firmware component of the OpenBM avr board.

1. Required libraries
----------------

You would need to have avr build environment installed. On Ubuntu 14.04 you
need to install following:

sudo apt-get install avr-libc gcc-avr avrdude


2. Compilation
---------------

To compile the project just execute the build.sh script with the according
customer settings as specified in Customers.ini. This file contains all
information about the used hardware and encodes default settings enbaled in
the firmware. An example customer "user" is already defined, reflecting my
own settings. Hence to build the project with settings "user" execute:

./clean.sh
./build.sh user

this results in bmwMonitor.out file which need to be flashed on-to OpenBM.

3. Installation
------------------
To install an avr programmer must be connected. Avrdude must installed.
Change Makefile.custom to reflect programmer you use, i.e. change
AVRDUDE_PROGRAMMERID line. In order to install execute:

./install.sh user

The firmware can also be installed with any other avr flashing tools.


4. Important & ToDo
------------------ 
In order the firmware to run OpenBM hardware must be used. OpenBM has
several hardware revisions (mainly old boards and new boards) which have
slightly different behaviour. According information about the used revision
must be set in Customers.ini

Bootloader is not finished yet and is currentl not working. The idea was
that the bootloader could be used for simple firmware uploading which could
be done through any I-Bus interface, i.e. the firmware would be sent over
I-Bus packages. Unfortunately it is not yet completly finished ;(
